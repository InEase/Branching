class Foo:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.x = x

    def get_x(self):
        print("Order 2: Foo.x ", self.x)
        self.hello()

    def hello(self):
        print("Order 4: In Plugin Hello", self.x)


# You can hook on more than one functions at a time
@before(Foo.get_x, Foo.hello)
def hello(*args):
    print("Order 1/3: Before Hook")
